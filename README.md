## Introduction
This project aims to tackle an image classification problem using ResNet as the model backbone. The dataset consists of RGB images, with 21024 samples for training and validation and 2344 samples for testing. The goal is to predict the corresponding object category ID from 100 different categories.

To enhance model performance, I employed several key techniques, including data augmentation, transfer learning, adaptive learning rate scheduling, and model ensembling. The core idea of my method is to ensemble three models based on ResNeXt as the backbone, forming a more robust and accurate classifier.
